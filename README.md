# Simple-Hopfield-Network-made-in-R
made my very first hopfield model in R

i trained a hopfield model to memorize an image and did some pre training before it was actually trained and the results was awesome

Original image:

Noisy pattern: (to see if the model will fix it and recall it)

and finally the results..

Result image:

although it was only partially correct, for a model its already good maybe 20-50 iterations should do the trick
